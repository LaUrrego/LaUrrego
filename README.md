After a diverse and fun adventure through business ops and managing special projects for global brands and companies, 
I’ve decided to take my hobby of tinkering with Python and turn it into a career. 

There is no better joy than the magic of having your imagination made real (almost tangible!) as a working, running, 
GROWING program on your screen. Taking this step with a Computer Science degree from Oregon State University is a nod 
to those times when I believed anything was possible, and I still do!

I love problem solving and being immersed in strong collaborative teams, be it locally or internationally! In addition 
to a love for 1's and 0's and the many shapes they take, I take pride in being pretty capable in the following supportive 
capacities: strategy development, international collaboration, workflow design, process optimization, and cross-functional 
team leadership. 



Currently learning and having fun with the following:
- Java, Assembly (MASM), Python, Swift, HTML, CSS
- Git, GitHub, Xcode, VS Code, Visual Studio 
- Learning Polish! (Already fluent in Spanish)
